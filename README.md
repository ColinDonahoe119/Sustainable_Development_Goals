# Sustainable Development Goals Analysis

This project analyzes GDP per capita and multiple Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators—with a focus on African nations—to explore patterns and compare discrepencies between developed and non-developed nations. I also perform regression analysis, where I attempt to predict the Climate action score (goal 13) with the Gender Equality score (goal 5), Decent work and economic growth score (goal 8), and industry, innovation, and infrastructure score (goal 9).

The dataset comes from the UN's sustainable development report of 2023. In 2015, The UN devised 17 specific goals to face a variety of humanitarian issues. This dataset contains 167 countries, and their grade for each of the 17 goals. Each grade is between 0 and 100, 100 being exceptional.
